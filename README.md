# example-repository

This repository was created to demonstrate how we could edit the README.md

Partner 1 keeps only this text and removes Partner 2's text

Partner 2 is adding new information in the README file for the exercise.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is Armando adding a new line of description on the Readme.md

This is a line added. Have a nice day!

Thank you for helping me solve my issue and allowing me to complete the exercise.
Have a good day! att. Katherin
